# CS405-Secure-Coding

**Portfolio Reflection**

	 While working on the security policy report, one thing that stood out is the importance of integrating security principles into the DevOps pipeline. This is referred to as DevSecOps, which is a software development life cycle method that prioritizes security throughout every phase (What Is DevSecOps and How Does It Work? | Synopsys, n.d.). Leaving security to the end of the development process can prove to be costly in many ways, and it also goes against the best practices of secure coding. Any coding defect or vulnerability that is introduced can lead to a security breach, and if not detected early, elevates risks for the organization by creating gaps and lags in mitigation.
	 
	 
	The evaluation and assessment of risk is critical to effectively mitigate vulnerabilities as soon as they are found. This is done by first identifying all critical and sensitive assets in the infrastructure and then undergoing a cybersecurity assessment using tools and strategies. One example is the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s cybersecurity framework which is a process that continuously monitors and assess threats with well-established criteria (Hager, n.d.). 
	
	
	Additionally, as most enterprises today operate in a dynamic and complex IT environment that includes native, virtual, and SAAS solutions, as well a variety of devices such as mobile, desktop, and IoT, it is important to move away from traditional cybersecurity measures that trust everything as long as it is in the network, and adopt a zero-trust policy to security. The zero-trust security architecture considers, not only the user that needs to be authenticated, but also every device, network, application, and data as well. These make up the five pillars of the zero-trust policy, and they offer organizations a more comprehensive platform-based security measure that considers all possible access points and secures them (Kueh, 2020).
	Lastly, the implementation of these tools, strategies, principles, and policies is a vital step in their effectiveness. By establishing a well-drawn out security policy, organizations can ensure that developers, administrators, and all stakeholders are in line with all security measures. A security policy will clearly define what is required, express the organization’s mindset about security, and provide an effective mechanism to hold teams accountable, all while upholding legal and ethical responsibilities.
